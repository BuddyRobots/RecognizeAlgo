AKAZE feature matching algorithm
by Philip Zeratul

An algorithm for detecting the orientation of the circuit component.

Usage:
./AKAZE template_DIR bounding_box_DIR

e.g.
./AKAZE battery.png bb.xml

Warning:
Don't use .jpg file as the template!
Because OpenCV has a bug when using .jpg and video camera at the same time.
